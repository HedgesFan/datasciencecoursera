# HelloWorld.md

## This is a markdown file

It was created on my local machine, then pushed up to GitHub via:

    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/HedgesFan/datasciencecoursera.git

(actually, I biffed that command and left off the .git part, but then
went and manually edited .git/config to fix the value)

    $ git add .
    $ git push

You can see what's set up via:

    $ git remote

or

    $git remote -v
